# Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science

This repository includes all the code used  in the book Analytical Skills for AI and Data Science and other additional information that I might want to share.

**The book will be available online on the last week of May 2020.**


### Tips for installing python

If you're new to python, I recommend downloading the [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).  Please follow that link and the instructions thereby provided.


### Organization

All code is provided as chapter-specific Jupyter notebooks (download instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install)) that are rendered on Github.
